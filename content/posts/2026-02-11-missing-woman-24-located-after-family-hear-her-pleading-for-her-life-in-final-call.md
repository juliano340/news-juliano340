Gabriella Cartagena, a 24-year-old woman from Marinette County, Wisconsin, who went missing on February 5, was located by local law enforcement on February 10. Authorities have not provided any details about her well-being, though her family has shared an update. Before she went missing, Cartagena had a distressing phone call with her family, during which she was heard pleading for her life. A person of interest in the case is in custody, and officials have promised to release more information soon.

The family noted the pair appeared “normal” and were headed to the grocery store. However, they said they soon received a call from Cartagena in which she was heard pleading, “Please do not shoot me. I am sorry.” Image credits: Menominee County Sheriff’s Office “The Marinette Police Department, along with other local authorities, initiated an extensive search to locate Gabriella Cartagena. The investigation led to the belief that Gabriella was in the area of Red Arrow Park in the City of Marinette prior to her disappearance,” a press release shared by the sheriff’s office earlier this week stated.

More information will be released as soon as possible,” failing to confirm whether Cartagena is deceased or alive. A GoFundMe campaign launched by Cartagena’s family indicates she has passed away Image credits: GoFundMe “My name is Alpachino Cartagena, and I am the older brother of Gabriella Cartagena, who recently passed away,” the online crowdfunding page states. “Gabriella’s passing was completely unexpected, and our family is still trying to process this sudden loss,” the message continues, adding, “During this incredibly difficult time, we are reaching out to our family, friends, and community for support.” Image credits: GoFundMe Alpachino concludes the GoFundMe appeal with a request for “financial assistance” to help ensure Gabriella receives the funeral she deserves to properly “honor her life.” As of this writing, $5,290 has been raised toward the $6,000 goal.
