## Resumo em 3 bullets
- **Topico 1**: ChatGPT-4o discontinuation caused emotional attachment and grief among users who saw the model as companion or lifeline
- **Topico 2**: Users reported positive impacts like improved mental health, social reconnection, and support for neurodivergent needs
- **Topico 3**: OpenAI plans to retire the model due to safety concerns, but many users prefer its empathy and creativity over newer versions

## Por que isso importa para devs
This case highlights how advanced AI models can form meaningful emotional bonds with users, creating genuine psychological attachment that becomes problematic when the technology is discontinued. The situation raises important questions about AI safety, user dependency, and the responsibility of tech companies when their products serve critical support functions for vulnerable users. It also demonstrates the tension between safety improvements and user experience preferences in AI development.

## O que muda na pratica
- Establish clear communication channels with users before discontinuing AI models that serve support functions
- Create migration paths or export options for user data and conversation histories
- Develop community support resources for users experiencing AI-related grief or dependency issues

## Contexto rapido
- ChatGPT-4o was discontinued by OpenAI on February 13, 2026 after facing safety criticisms and lawsuits
- The model was particularly valued for its emotional intelligence and creativity compared to newer versions
- Approximately 100,000 daily users (0.1% of weekly users) were still using the 4o model at time of discontinuation
