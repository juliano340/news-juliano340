In a normal, healthy, functional family, your relatives will try to create an environment in which everyone feels both respected and safe. But unfortunately, this isn’t the case in some households. Things can get pretty toxic.
One internet user shared how the dynamic in his family shifted once he and his wife were getting ready to welcome their first child into the world. The man’s mother started showing some increasingly hostile behavior toward his spouse, which led to more and more tension in their daily life. The man detailed the drama that happened in a candid online post, asking the internet to weigh in on the sensitive situation and how he (mis)handled things.
