Many of us are taught to turn the other cheek and not stoop to someone’s level if they insult us. But then there’s the crowd who firmly believes that when they go low, you most definitely should go lower. So low, in fact, that it burns…
That’s exactly what one woman did when her sister humiliated her in public recently. The woman, who has a traumatic brain injury, says was celebrating landing a new job, when her sibling blurted out that she only got the position because of her disability. Shocked at being called a DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) hire, she clapped back by bringing up the fact that her sister had slept her way to the top. Needless to say, things got ugly fast.
