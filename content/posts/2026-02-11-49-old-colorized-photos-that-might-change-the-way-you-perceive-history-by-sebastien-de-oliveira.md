French artist Sébastien de Oliveira is best known for his meticulous colorization of historical black and white photographs, a process that blends archival research with a distinctly artistic sensibility. Drawing on his background as a painter and photographer, de Oliveira approaches each image with careful attention to period-accurate details, studying clothing, architecture, materials, and environmental cues to ensure that every color choice feels grounded in its historical context. His goal is not strict realism, but emotional authenticity, using color as a way to reconnect modern viewers with moments that might otherwise feel distant or abstract.More info: InstagramClick here & follow us for more lists, facts, and stories.#1Computer lesson in 1972.© Photo: sebcolorisation#2Janet Leigh...
