Some photos stop you in your tracks. Not because they’re perfectly sharp or technically flawless, but because they capture a moment at the exact right time.
A meteor streaking across the sky during an aurora, a rainbow kissing a boat at Niagara Falls, or even a fox running away with a Mcdonald's order — these are the moments that make photography feel magical.
