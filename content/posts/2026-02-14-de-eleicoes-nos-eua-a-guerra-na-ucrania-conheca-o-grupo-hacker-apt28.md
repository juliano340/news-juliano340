## Resumo em 3 bullets
- **Topico 1**: APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, is a Russian state-backed hacking group linked to GRU military intelligence.
- **Topico 2**: The group focuses on geopolitical cyber-espionage, targeting governments, critical infrastructure, and political organizations worldwide.
- **Topico 3**: Notable attacks include the 2016 DNC email leak, Olympic doping data leaks, and cyber operations supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.

## Por que isso importa para devs
APT28 represents a persistent, state-sponsored threat actor whose operations directly influence geopolitical events. Unlike financially motivated cybercrime, their campaigns aim to destabilize adversaries, manipulate democratic processes, and support military objectives. Their technical sophistication and state backing make them a formidable adversary for national security and critical infrastructure defenders.

## O que muda na pratica
- Implement advanced threat detection to identify APT28's spear-phishing and zero-day exploitation tactics.
- Strengthen incident response plans to quickly contain breaches involving state-sponsored actors like APT28.
- Conduct regular security awareness training focused on recognizing sophisticated social engineering campaigns linked to APT28.

## Contexto rapido
- APT28 has been active since the mid-2000s and is associated with the Russian military intelligence service GRU.
- The group uses custom tools like X-Agent malware to target Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android systems across government and defense sectors.
- Russia denies involvement, but evidence ties APT28's operations to Russian state interests and geopolitical objectives.
