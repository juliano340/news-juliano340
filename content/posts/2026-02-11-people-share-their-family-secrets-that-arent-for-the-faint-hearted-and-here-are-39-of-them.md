No one enjoys keeping an unsettling family secret. No matter how much of an impenetrable vault you think you are, this confidential piece of information will keep gnawing at you until you reach a point where you just have to spill the beans to someone. These people are using Reddit as a platform to unburden themselves while hiding behind the anonymity of a username. They responded to this loaded question: “What’s a secret your family doesn’t think you know, but you do?” Many of the stories you’re about to read may very well be plots to a twisted thriller drama. You may want to have some popcorn with you as you read through. Click here & follow us for more lists, facts, and stories.#1Up until today, the secret was that I am gay. I came out to my extended family this weekend after telling my parents that I was done hiding (I'd kept it secret several years at my mom's request.) Ironically, the response from my aunts/uncles was way better than my parents', they all said they still loved me and my mom said I was ruining her life 🙃.#2I absolutely adored my mother. She was a single mother who got a master's in education while taking care of the three of us all the way up to working being a head of a department in the DOE. I never seen her drink, shout, act immature, act out in any unbecoming way etc. My whole life the one thing people commented on was how "classy" my mother is. Then two years ago when she passed away and I was cleaning out her house, I ended up accidently taking one of her boxes of papers from the attic thinking it was mine. It was full of court documents talking about an affair my mother had with a married colleague where she got allegedly got so upset he ended it that she started to stalk and harass him and he filed criminal charges on her as well as brought it to HR at her former job. The things he says my mother did in those documents, I can't imagine in a hundred years. Yet I also couldn't imagine her having an affair with this guy at all but she admits it in the paperwork. I know why she left her state job and we moved to DC- basically there was some kind of deal made where she would leave and it would go away. And the criminal case was also pretty much dropped with the expectation and deal she would never contact him or bother him again. Like [why?]. It's made me really realize that you don't know ANYONE really.EDIT: I really didn't expect to get all these nice and respectful replies. I realized that a lot of you are right and I'm judging my mom a bit to harshly when she did everything else right and had been a great mother. Everyone makes a lapse in judgment sometimes especially when it comes to love and it seems she owned up to it and took responsibility. Thanks. I feel a lot better about it.© Photo: User#3My aunt divorced my uncle in the 50s, with six children. She had no job nor any means to support her & her kids and had to split the family up, sending half the kids to her sister’s house while she & the other three stayed in another sister’s home. She and her six children were treated like dirt. No one could understand why she left her husband. She died in the 1980s taking the truth to her grave. I became close to one of her daughters who also died, recently. But on her deathbed, drugged up from all the medication, she told me the truth. She told me her father, the uncle whom my aunt divorced “touched her all over when she was 12.” 😳😢.© Photo: User#4H**l, I am positively mortified hearing about all these stories in here. Mine is a bit light one. I am from a very conservative country, and arranged marriages were the norm here, until a generation ago. Mine uncle's marriage was the first love marriage in our family, and it happened after a lot of persuasions with the Elders. Long before that, my uncle once took me to see his gf in the McDonalds. I was hardly 5, and I remembered the woman as a tall amiable one, who gave me her burgers to eat. As we were going away, I told uncle that I am gonna tell mother...
