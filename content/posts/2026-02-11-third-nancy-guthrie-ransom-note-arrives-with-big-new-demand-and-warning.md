A third alleged ransom note in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie has now surfaced, this time sent directly to TMZ with a fresh cryptocurrency demand.
According to the outlet, the new letter demands one bitcoin, roughly $66,000, in exchange for information about the “name of the individual involved” in the alleged kidnapping of Savannah Guthrie’s mother.
The note reportedly included a working bitcoin address.
“They said they want one bitcoin sent to a bitcoin address that we have confirmed is active,” TMZ host Harvey Levin revealed today (February 11). 
“It’s a real bitcoin address, and as they put it, time is more than relevant.”
