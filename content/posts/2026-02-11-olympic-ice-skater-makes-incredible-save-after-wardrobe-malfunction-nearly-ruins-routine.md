At the Olympics, a wardrobe malfunction isn’t just embarrassing; it can be a serious safety hazard, lead to point deductions, and even cost athletes a medal, despite all their hard work.
On Monday, February 9, one such mishap nearly turned into a disaster for Canadian ice dancer Piper Gilles and her partner, Paul Poirier, during their rhythm dance segment in the ice dance competition of the 2026 Winter Olympics.
“Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier delivered possibly the greatest costume save in ice dance history,” reacted one social media user to the mishap.
