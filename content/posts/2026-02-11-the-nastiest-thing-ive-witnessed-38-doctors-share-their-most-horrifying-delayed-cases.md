A lot of people tend to go into denial when they feel like something's wrong with their body. “Eh, I’m sure this headache’s nothing. I’ll just pop a couple tablets of ibuprofen and call it a day.” But if you’re in extreme pain, your symptoms haven’t gone away for days or you start to feel delirious, it’s definitely time to go to the hospital. In fact, your body is probably screaming at you that you should have called an ambulance days ago! Medical professionals on Reddit have been sharing stories of patients who waited far too long before going to the hospital, so we’ve compiled a list of their most disturbing stories below. We’ll warn you right now that some of these are incredibly hard to stomach, but we hope they’ll be reminders that you should never ignore health warnings. And when in doubt, just get it checked out!Click here & follow us for more lists, facts, and stories.#1Nurse here.I work in a very rural hospital, and we have a patient population that seems to avoid the hospital at all costs. I have had so many, usually related to diabetics with foot sores- almost always resulting in amputation of a toe (or more).However, my favorite was an elderly farmer who came in with chest pain that, 'Wouldn't go away', as he put it. When we asked him if he had it before had it before- he had said that he had been having chest pain on and off for years, but it would typically go away after he grabbed his electric fence.Apparently, the first time he had the pain- he was standing out near an electric fence on his farm, and he reached out to steady himself and accidentally grabbed the electric fence, which shocked him, and made the pain go away. So after that, whenever he would have the pain, he just went and grabbed the fence and it made him feel better. He had literally been cardioverting himself for years.He was fixed up and sent on his way- but we all still chuckle about it now and then because he was so nonchalant about it.© Photo: FlaviusArrianus#2I’m still just a nursing student, but my professor told us a story of when he was an ER nurse. An elderly 80 something year old woman came in to the ER, and as he assessed her, he noticed her oral temperature was normal despite her neck being extremely hot to the touch. He decided to take a rectal temperature, which ended up being like 103 or something crazy. While he was down there, he noticed something peeking out of her v****a and proceeded to remove it. It was an old sock. She said her uterus had prolapsed months before and she was using the sock to keep it in. They began treating her for TSS immediately but sadly she went septic and died later that day. Tongue in cheek, he told us she died of toxic sock syndrome. 😩💀 nurses have to use dark humor to cope.© Photo: pinkawapuhi#3A&E/ED doctor here! A farmer in his 70s reluctantly came in with his wife after falling over outside while wrangling a sheep one WEEK earlier. He did not want to be there but had been “forced” to come by his wife who was worried about him. On questioning/examining he was pale, short of breath, and clearly in pain all over the right side of his chest but not wanting to show it! X-ray and bloods showed he’d broken loads of ribs, punctured his lung and bled profusely into his chest and was now very anaemic!© Photo: LPScot#4Elderly woman fell at home and broke both femurs. Son thought she just needed to rest so he carried her to her bed. She laid there in her own filth for 3 days before anyone called 911. The son lives with her, and there’s family next door as well. HOW. WHY?!© Photo: rirry#5Former medic here. Called to a patient who had cut their leg while chopping wood about a week prior and now it was really itchy. Old gentleman, didn’t drive, lived alone. Got to his house, unwrapped the ungodly swollen leg to find that he’d tried to superglue the wound closed and maggots had commenced to growing inside. The itching he was feeling was the writhing maggots under his skin.© Photo: LillyPasta#6Had a patient brou...
